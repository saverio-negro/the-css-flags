# The CSS Flags

The CSS Flags is a very simple project that I worked on to practice my CSS skills, and it was also quite a lot of fun, if I'm being honest.

Essentially, it's just a simple website showing flags from countries that I harbor a particular interest into, which were designed entirely using HTML and CSS.
